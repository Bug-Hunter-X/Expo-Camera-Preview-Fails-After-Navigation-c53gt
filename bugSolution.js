The solution involves using the `onMount` hook from the `react-native-reanimated` library to ensure the camera is properly initialized and mounted before rendering the preview.  This forces a remount of the camera when the component is re-rendered after navigation.  Here's an example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';
import { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const CameraScreen = () => {
  const cameraRef = useRef(null);
  const opacity = useSharedValue(0);

  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() =>({
    opacity: withTiming(opacity.value),
  }));

  const onMount = () => {
     opacity.value = 1; //Animate in
  }

  return (
    <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={CameraType.back} ref={cameraRef} onMount={onMount}>
      {/* Camera Controls */}
    </Camera>
  );
};

export default CameraScreen;
```
